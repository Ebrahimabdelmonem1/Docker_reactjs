# ReactJS Application with Docker

This project demonstrates how to containerize a ReactJS application using Docker. It provides an easy way to run the application inside a Docker container for consistent deployment across different environments.

## Features

- Containerized ReactJS application using Docker.
- Multi-stage Docker build to optimize image size and performance.
- Simple commands to build and run the application in a Docker container.

## Project Structure

├── Dockerfile 
├── public/ 
├── src/ 
├── package.json 
└── README.md


- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Docker image and the steps for building the application.
- **public/**: Contains the static assets for the ReactJS application.
- **src/**: Contains the ReactJS source code.
- **package.json**: Lists the project dependencies.

## Requirements

1. **Docker**: Installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Setup and Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
#git clone https://github.com/Ebrahimabdelmonem1/Docker_reactjs.git
#cd Docker_reactjs


Step 2: Build the Docker Image
#docker build -t reactjs-app 

Step 3: Run the Docker Container
#docker run -p 3000:3000 reactjs-app

Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Multi-Stage Build
The Dockerfile is designed to use a multi-stage build process. The first stage installs dependencies and builds the ReactJS application, while the second stage serves the optimized production build using an NGINX server.

Clean-Up
To stop and remove the Docker container, run:
#docker stop <container_id>
#docker rm <container_id>


To remove the Docker image, run:
#docker rmi reactjs-app
